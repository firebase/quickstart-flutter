# Firebase Auth Quickstart

## Introduction

- [Read more about Firebase Auth](https://firebase.google.com)

## Getting Started

- [Add Firebase to your Flutter Project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup).

This example contains Email / Password login and signup using Firebase in a
Flutter app. In order to run the example, you'll need to set up your app in
the Firebase console. You will then want to run the flutterfire_cli to
sync all API keys locally to this application.

- Run `firebase emulators:start` to start the local Firebase emulator suite.

- Run `flutter run` to start the app.

### Email/Password Setup

- Go to the [Firebase Console][fir-console] and navigate to your project:
  - Select the **Auth** panel and then click the **Sign In Method** tab.
  - Click **Email/Password** and turn on the **Enable** switch, then click **Save**.
