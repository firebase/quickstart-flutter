## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get up and running with Firebase Data Connect. For more detailed instructions, check out the [official documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/data-connect/quickstart).

### 1. Connect to your Firebase project

1. If you haven't already, create a Firebase project.
    1. In the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com), click
        **Add project**, then follow the on-screen instructions.
2. Enable Email/Password Sign-in method [here](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers).

### 2. Cloning the repository

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/firebase/quickstart-flutter.git
   ```
2. Configure flutterfire
This will automatically download and set up firebase for your project:

### 4. Populate the database
In VS Code, open the `quickstart-flutter/dataconnect/dataconnect/moviedata_insert.gql` file and click the
 `Run (local)` button at the top of the file.

If youâ€™d like to confirm that the data was correctly inserted,
open `quickstart-flutter/dataconnect/movie-connector/queries.gql` and run the `ListMovies` query.
